## ROLEPLAY FIGHT HELPER

This small app - made with ReactJS - deserves to help the game masters when a fight occurs.

You can add players with their init, kill / revive them when necessary, and hit next to know which player is playing next.

If you are a roleplay game master, please let me know if some features are missing for you, I'll do my best !

The app is host here : [http://liquat-design.com/react/jdr/](http://liquat-design.com/react/jdr/) , you are welcome to use it and give me feedbacks !
